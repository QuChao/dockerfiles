    - `:latest` & `:edge`: Based on `alpine:latest` and `alpine:edge`, includes a handy tool named [su-exec](https://github.com/ncopa/su-exec/) to exec commands with different privileges in containers.
    - `:centos`: Based on `centos:latest` with [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) & [gosu](https://github.com/tianon/gosu/) pre-installed.
